# SwiftDTO

![Overview](/images/json2swift.jpg)

Generate swift DTO files from CoreData model

A macOS command line tool that generates Swift data models based on one or more CoreData model files in XML format.

Written in Swift 3.

## Features

- Generates immutable Swift struct definitions
- Generates thread-safe code to create structs from JSON data
- Converts JSON Date representations to Swift Date objects
- Creates graceful DTO objects. All properties are optionals
- Processes XML files, which represent a CoreData model, created with Xcodes CoreData editor

## What is code generation?

Using a JSON-to-Swift code generator is very different from using a JSON library API. If you have never worked with a code generator before, check out [this blog post](https://ijoshsmith.com/2016/11/03/swift-json-library-vs-code-generation/) for a quick overview.

## How to get it

- Download the `SwiftDTO` app binary from the latest [release](https://github.com/a7ex/SwiftDTO/releases)
- Copy `SwiftDTO` to your desktop
- Open a Terminal window and run this command to give the app permission to execute:

```
chmod +x ~/Desktop/SwiftDTO
```

Or build the tool in Xcode yourself:

- Clone the repository / Download the source code
- Build the project
- Open a Finder window to the executable file

- Drag `SwiftDTO` from the Finder window to your desktop

## How to install it

Assuming that the `SwiftDTO` app is on your desktopâ€¦

Open a Terminal window and run this command:
```
cp ~/Desktop/SwiftDTO /usr/local/bin/
```
Verify `SwiftDTO` is in your search path by running this in Terminal:
```
SwiftDTO
```
You should see the tool respond like this:
```
Expected string argument defining the path to the XCModelData file!
Usage: ./SwiftDTO [string]
```
Now that a copy of `SwiftDTO` is in your search path, delete it from your desktop.

You're ready to go! ðŸŽ‰

## How to use it

Open a Terminal window and pass `SwiftDTO` a file path to a CoreData model XML file:
```
SwiftDTO /path/to/some/CDData.xcdatamodel/contents
```
The tool creates the swift files in the working directory, unless you specify an output folder as the second command line argument.

The source code download includes an `example` directory with a `CDData` CoreData file so that you can test it out.

## Structure and property names



## Date parsing

`SwiftDTO` creates Date objects from strings or timestamps
